# 🔧 Solving Bandwidth Issues After Switch Replacement

## 🧠 Lab Purpose
Due to hardware failure, **CSW1** has been temporarily replaced with a **non-Cisco switch** until a satisfactory replacement 
can be delivered. Upon installation and configuration of the temporary switch, there is a **noticeable decrease of network 
bandwidth** between the core and distribution layers. You are provided authorization to the **access and distribution 
switches**, and you have been asked to determine and correct the problem.

> Example:  
> In this lab we will verify EtherChannel set-up and modify configurations to allow for a mult-vendor environment

## 🖥️ Topology Overview

> Devices involved in EtherChannel configuration: 
> - DSW1 ↔ CSW1 (EtherChannel bundle)
> - DSW2 ↔ CSW1 (EtherChannel bundle)
> - DSW1 ↔ CSW2 (EtherChannel bundle)
> - DSW2 ↔ CSW2 (EtherChannel bundle)

**CSW1 is the non-Cisco temporary replacement switch**

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

### 🔹 DSW1 Verification and Configuration
en
show cdp neighbors
show etherchannel summary
show running-configuration
conf t
interface range f0/9 - 10
no channel-group 11 mode auto
channel-group 11 mode active

### 🔹 DSW2 Verification and Configuration
en
show cdp neighbors
show etherchannel summary
show running-configuration
conf t
interface range f0/7 - 8
no channel-group 21 mode auto
channel-group 21 mode active
